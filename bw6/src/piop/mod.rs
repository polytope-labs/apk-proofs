// PIOP stays for Polynomial Interactive Oracle Proof.
// It's a type of information-theoretical interactive proof systems where to convince the verifier that
// a relation holds, the prover sends bounded-degree polynomials, that are accessible by the verifier
// as "oracles", meaning it can query them for evaluations in some public-coin points.
// A PIOP can be lifted to a SNARK by implementing the oracle queries with a polynomial
// commitment scheme under some computational assumption and performing a Fiat-Shamir transform.

// ProverProtocol and VerifierProtocol together encapsulate a PIOP optimized for a limited class of computations.
// The computation is expressed in a polynomial form in a way similar to AIR arithmetization:

// 0. Following PLONK we fix a "domain", a subgroup in the multiplicative group of the field of size n and its generator w.
//    Now we can interpret an array of length n as a degree < n polynomial, by interpolating over the domain:
//    [p_0,...,p_{n-1}] is equivalent to the unique polynomial p of degree < n, such that p(w^i) = p_i, i = 0,...,n-1.
//    Polynomial p'(Z) = p(Zw) represents the left circular shift [p_1,...,p_0] of the array:
//    p'(w^i) = p(w^{i+1}) = p_{i+1}, i = 0,...,n-2, and p'(w^{n-1}) = p(w^n) = p(w^0) = p_0.

// 1. The computation state is represented as registers, arrays of length n. Together registers can be visualized as a table,
//    where each row corresponds to the computation state at some step. Registers give raise to register polynomials.
//    The consecutive element of a register r can be addressed using the shifted polynomial r(Zw).

// 2. The computation is defined by a constraint polynomial f. It is a univariate polynomial of the form:
//    f(Z) = P(r1(Z),...,rm(Z),r1(Zw),...,rm(Zw)), where P is a small-degree multivariate polynomial that is known to the verifier.
//    degree of f is then <= (n-1)deg(P)
//    The computation is valid iff the constraint polynomial is zero for every 2 consecutive rows:
//    f(w^i) = f(r1(w^i),...,rm(w^i),r1(w^{i+1}),...,rm(w^i{i+1})) = 0, i = 0,...,n-1.
//    Notice that the constraint should also hold between the last and the first rows of the state table.

// The formula above says that the computation is valid iff f = 0 over the domain or, in other words, f has a root at every point of the domain.
// Recall that z_0 is a root of f iff the polynomial (Z-z_0) divides f(Z), i.e. f(Z) = q(Z)(Z-z_0). Inductively we get that
// the computation is valid iff there exists a polynomial q such that f(Z) = q(Z)(Z-w^0)...(Z-w^{n-1}) = q(Z)(Z^n - 1).

// A PIOP for the arithmetization described above is:
// 0. Verifier has an oracle access to some "public input" registers, and knows P, a formula for the constraint polynomial.
//    Prover knows the same, and has a satisfying assignment to other registers,
//    consistent both with the public input registers and the constraint polynomial.
// 1. Prover sends register polynomials r1,...,rl, other than "public input" registers.
// 2. Prover computes the constraint polynomial f, the quotient polynomial q(Z) = f(Z) / (Z^n - 1) and sends q.
// 3. Verifier for a random point z:
//    - computes f(z) using the formula P and queries to the register polynomials in z and zw
//    - computes z^n - 1
//    - queries q in z and checks f(z) = q(z) * (z^n - 1) holds

// As the constraint polynomial degree is bounded, the soundness of the protocol follows from Schwartz–Zippel lemma.

// The implementation differs from the abstract protocol described above in the following.
// 1. It's essential to have multiple constraints f_i such that each f_i is 0. To reduce this case to the protocol above,
//    there's an additional round of interaction: after the prover sends the registers, it receives a random challenge phi
//    from the verifier, that is used to aggregate the constraints: f = \sum phi^i f_i
// 2. There's another additional round of interaction specific to the "packed" case.
// 3. To reduce communication (oracle queries), instead of querying multiple registers in zw,
//    verifier is given the "linearization" polynomial that is enough to be queried once.
//    It is efficient if the constraint polynomial is linear in all "shifted" terms ri(Zw).
